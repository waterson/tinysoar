. Depending on implementing chunking, get rid of intermediate data
  production data structures, and have rule.y generate the RETE
  network data structures directly. (Don't want to burn the space on
  the RCX if we don't need to for chunking or some other reason. Plus,
  this would get a fair bit of code _out_ of rete.c) Not sure how
  applicable this is anymore...

. Chunking:

  - deal with chunking of negative conditions
  - figure out how to do bottom-up chunking (instead of all-goals)
  - clean up the horror that is make_production
  - look for leaks

. Implement conjunctive negative conditions.

. Implement semantic verification in rule.y.

. Implement some sort of timer mechanism. Could do this by exposing
  the system timer directly as a WME, and implementing RHS
  expressions. Alternatively, implement some sort of `timeout'
  mechanism to avoid busy-waiting (...but we're busy-waiting anyway
  with the |wait| operator).

. Somehow, wobble-2.soar is leaking memory.
