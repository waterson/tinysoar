(3) Figure out how to do chunking and/or justification.

(4) Depending on (3), get rid of intermediate data production data
    structures, and have rule.y generate the RETE network data
    structures directly. (Don't want to burn the space on the RCX if
    we don't need to for chunking or some other reason. Plus, this
    would get a fair bit of code _out_ of rete.c)

(7) Implement ``dot attribute'' notation for conditions in rule.y.

(8) Implement conjunctive negative conditions.

(9) Implement semantic verification in rule.y.

(14) Implement the allocator for the runtime.

(17) Fix architecture s.t. operator tie (and operator conflict, and
     operator no-change) doesn't repeatedly fire in the top-state.

(18) Figure out why ops-7.soar is failing: two well ordered
     productions, but a third unordered, should cause an operator-tie.

(19) Figure out why rest of operator tests (ops-9.soar, ops-13.soar,
     op-14.soar) are failing.

(20) Deal with resolution of impasses. Depends on (3), above.
