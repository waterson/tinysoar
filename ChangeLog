The rete propogation stuff is buggy right now. The problem is that:

1) I'm just naively letting stuff meander down the net. This'll cause
instantiation nodes to get tickled more than once. I think I need to
make the tests more restrictive by default; esp. simple_test() should
return zero at the end?

2) (Maybe the same as 1, above) I need to be able to go out and check
working memory for values. When I see a WME in simple_test() that
doesn't have the same attribute as the node I'm looking at, I should
go out to working memory and see if there is any element that'll
satisfy my conditions, and only then propogate the stuff onward...
