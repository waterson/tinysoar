I've got the basic stuff for alpha nodes, memory nodes, and positive
join nodes hooked up. I'm starting to go through debugging
|rete_add_wme()|, and am bombing out in the right-addition routine
because I'm not getting a binding for the `S1' stuff. Need to debug
that.

There's also starting to be a bit of redundant code, so a bit of
refactoring will probably be in order shortly.

The rete propogation stuff is buggy right now. The problem is that:

1) I'm just naively letting stuff meander down the net. This'll cause
instantiation nodes to get tickled more than once. I think I need to
make the tests more restrictive by default; esp. simple_test() should
return zero at the end?

2) (Maybe the same as 1, above) I need to be able to go out and check
working memory for values. When I see a WME in simple_test() that
doesn't have the same attribute as the node I'm looking at, I should
go out to working memory and see if there is any element that'll
satisfy my conditions, and only then propogate the stuff onward...
