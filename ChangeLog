Made disjunctive tests work.

<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=516730&group_id=42131&atid=432196>

Added a regression test harness.


Monday, March 18, 2002

Fixed bogus linked-list manipulation in the beta_node_type_negative
case for do_right_(addition|removal) that was causing us to end up in
an infinite loop. Overzealous conversion to `for' loops probably
introduced this bug. :-/


Saturday, March 16, 2002

Fixed a problem with the `export' command: we were crashing during
export if a beta node had no beta tests.

Fixed a problem with operator selection: `better' and `worse'
preferences were dominating _every_ other candidate in the list, not
just their referent. I think this may be the problem I was seeing with
the `culled too many candidates' bugs.


Thursday, March 14, 2002

Fixed the `print' command so that it returned a result to the Tcl
interpreter instead of just printf'ing. This allows script to inspect
the agent's state (e.g., the ^output-link).


Wednesday, March 13, 2002

Get rid of the `impasse' test type: since we're supporting `pure'
Soar-8.3 semantics, there can never be attribute impasses (which,
AFAICT, is the only way that impasses can arise).

Been fixing problems with clean up of o-supported preferences in
substates. Implemented a simple garbage collection scheme that removes
`unreachable' preferences; i.e., preferences that are no longer
reachable from a goal in the goal stack.

Started working on a simple eight-puzzle hack as a test-harness for
substates and, eventually, chunking.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, February 12, 2002

Removed the assertion in do_left_addition() requiring negative nodes
to have a non-null |wme|. Not sure why I thought I needed that.

Changed the ^motor-n annotation on the output link to take symbolic
constants: `forward', `reverse', `brake', and `off'.


Thursday, January 24, 2002

Fix bug 507849,

<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=507849&group_id=42131&atid=432196>

When doing right-removal on a negative node, we need to iterate
through the remaining right-memories for each token to see if the
token is still blocked.

Fix bug 507841,

<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=507841&group_id=42131&atid=432196>:

the value test is optional.

Fixed the parser so that we don't o-support when doing a negated test
on an ^operator attribute.


Wednesday, January 23, 2002

Fix a problem with o-rejects: if an o-reject is created and there's
not slot to apply it on, we crash!


Wednesday, January 9, 2002

Fix lexer to grok signed integer constants. Swap type and value bits
in symbol_t so that we handle signed integer constants correctly in
other parts of the code. Streamline symbol bit monkeying a bit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, December 31, 2001

Release tinysoar-0.1.

Thursday, December 20, 2001

Take a first crack at implementing `.attr' notation.


Wednesday, December 19, 2001

Saved 100 or so bytes on the H8 by getting rid of bit fields in the
allocator. Fixed the problem with `bumper.soar': wasn't taking
`cond->acceptable' into account when trying to re-use beta nodes.


Monday, December 17, 2001

Added license headers, tidied up comments a bit.


Sunday, December 16, 2001

Got a proper run-loop for the RCX; i.e., one that actually pays
attention to the `Run' and `On-Off' buttons.


Saturday, December 15, 2001

Converted symbol_t and variable_binding_t from bit-packed structures
to raw unsigned integers with hand bit-twiddling. Had to do this to
get around the fact that different compilers (even different gcc
back-ends) order the bit fields differently. (I need the order to be
consistent so I can initialize unions with a single unsigned value.)


Friday, December 14, 2001

Tracked the remaining problems with the RCX: turns out the
h8300-hitachi-hms version of gcc orders bitfields in strucutres
differently than the x86 version does. So, the code I have that tries
to treat word-wide structures as unsigned values got the bitfield
stuff backwards. Gonna have to do those by hand.

Also cleaned up a bunch of the macros that are used to specify
symbols: the parameters to these things were randomly ordered as far
as I could tell.


Sunday, December 9, 2001

Implemented a brain-dead, slow as molasses, first-fit allocator to run
on the RCX, and a simple test harness to bang on it. Implemented a
lame ``simulator'' for the RCX so I could verify that things were
working right.

Using the harness, I found two leaks in wmem.c. The first had to do
with the fact that reconsider preferences were marked as o-supported
(because they test the operator), and so were never getting
removed. Fixed this by forcing reconsider preferences to be
i-suppored. The second leak had to do with the fact that we don't
duplicate check o-supported preferences, and so were ending up with an
ever-increasing supply of o-supported preferences in a slot.

The harness was also useful in detecting the fact that I'd passed the
arguments to MAKE_SYMBOL in the wrong order!

The RCX still doesn't run Soar, but I think I'm getting closer. (It
currently just sits idle for about three seconds, and then starts to
spasmodically pulse the motor.)


Thursday, December 6, 2001

Banged around with the Lego RCX a bit, checked in a bunch of test
cases so I remember how to do stuff. Cleaned up makefiles so I can do
`objdir'-style builds. Added a `lego' target for an RCX-based agent.


Sunday, October 28, 2001

Silly change to fix all the pointers from |void* foo| to |void
*foo|. I bored!


Monday, June 11, 2001

Need to make sure that o-support works. I've enhanced p2.soar a bit so
that when you set |^found-line t|, it will just start selecting a
``wait'' operator. But since the |implement*find-line*move-forward|
production tests the operator, we should leave the |^motor-a 100| and
|^motor-c 100| attributes on the output link!

Also, I could spend some time figuring out why the
|implement*find-line*detect-line| production won't match when
|^sensor-a|'s value is changed. (I suspect that I punted on integer
comparison somewhere!)

                             * * *

Spent a bit more time digging into the numeric comparison stuff, and I
think the problem is in |process_tests()|, where we unilaterally
assume that a constant test can be done by the alpha network. Fixed
it, yay! Still need to do o-support, though...


Thursday, June 7, 2001

Okay, I think negative node stuff is working pretty much correctly
now. _Still_ have a weird problem with WMEs being left over after
|init-soar|, which is clear now with some of the improved |dump-rete|
fu that I've added.

Time to start filling in some of the architecture & runtime stuff and
making bigger tests?


Friday, June 1, 2001

I have the negative stuff all wrong. I have no idea what I was
thinking when I first wrote it. This is the place to start hacking
next.


Saturday, Feburary 10, 2001

Found a couple bone headed mistakes in my hand-rolled linked list
code. That fixed the problem with `init-soar'. Moved the `id' and
`attr' fields out of the `preferences' struct. Replaced them with a
back-pointer to the slot.

Fixed `wmem_remove_preference()' to take a preference pointer (instead
of the same parameter list that `wmem_add_preference()' takes). I did
this because I realized that it should be legal to have >1 identical
preferences in a slot. For example, two different productions assert
the same preference. When one of the instantiations dies, you want to
be sure you yank the right preference. (So that when the other dies,
it'll find /its/ preference.)

I expanded p2.soar, adding a production to set `^found-line t' on the
top-state. It uncovered several bugs:

1. Conditions that compare integer values are broken. (I'm not even
   sure I ever implemented them.)

2. Negative conditions are broken.

   - The don't match properly; e.g., doing

     % pref -a 3 ^sensor-a 75 +

     will properly create a condition that matches
    `implement*find-line*detect-line'; however, creating the
    `^fount-line t' attribute won't retract `propose*find-line'.

   - When we do `init-soar', we're

3. `init-soar' is still crashing. This happens because we weren't
   checking the retraction queue before adding a new instantiation, and
   we ended up with duplicates in the queue.

4. Fixing (3) makes it so that we now don't (appear to) properly
   retract `implement*find-line*move-forward' when a new operator gets
   selected.

On another tangent, it might make sense to have two kinds of
preference structures: one that takes a reference, and one that
doesn't. Save a bit of space, anyway: I bet most preferences are
unary.


Wednesday, Feburary 7, 2001

Went ahead and hacked preferences to be threaded by
instantiation. This probably makes it even more important to move the
`id' and `attr' fields out of the `preference' struct, and just re-use
the values from the slot. (Ideally, we wouldn't even need a
back-pointer to the slot...)

There still are some problems with `init-soar' that I need to track
down. Also, `p2.soar' is acting weird. Need to look at that.


Monday, February 5, 2001

Tinkered with making it so that an instantiation remembers the list of
unbound variables. When the time comes for an instantiation to be
removed, we just ``run the instantiation backwards'', removing all the
preferences that the instantiation created by re-evaluating the RHS
action.

This almost works, except for one problem. The WMEs in the
instantiation's token may very well be gone by the time you're ready
to remove the instantiation!

That doubly-linked list is starting to smell better...


Sunday, February 4, 2001

Spent some time debugging the mysterious crash on Win32. Added the
`/MDd' option and debugged a place where I was allocating a block that
was too small. At least now I can reproduce the crash on Windows!

It looks like the problem has to do with updating the preference's
`next_in_instantiation' pointer when we remove a preference from the
linked list of preferences. It's left dangling, pointing at
garbage. (Search on `XXX safe?' in wmem_remove_preference().)

If I can't figure this out, I might need to make a doubly-linked list
of preferences that are owned by each instantiation so I can yank it
there. Hrm, need to think about this a bit more...

                        *       *       *

Maybe I don't need to remember what preferences are owned by an
instantiation at all. Instead, I could just re-process the RHS using
the instantiation that's about to get nuked.

Okay, I think I see the problem with that idea: the instantiation
doesn't remember any identifiers that get generated for unbound
variables. So we won't know how to remove those. Grr.


Sunday, January 21, 2001

I've got some weird corruption crasher going on, Linux only, after
loading `p1.soar' and elaborating a couple of times. It looks like a
preference is holding a dangling pointer in its
`next_in_instantiation' field.

In the spirit of forward flailing, I cobbled together simple negative
conditions in the RETE net; enough to get `p2.soar' nominally
`working'. (It's one frigging production, so it's not like I have a
clue whether this stuff'll fly.) Need to debug in earnest at some
point.

I should create a `preferences' command so that I can add `found-line'
preference to the state to debug the negative condition foo.


Tuesday, January 16, 2001

Got a crude stab at getting the operator decision logic implemented. I
think I might be running into another RETE bug; can't seem to the the
`reconsider' production to fire in `p1.soar'.

                          *       *       *

Okay, so I think I figured out what was wrong: had an off-by-one in
the rete code and was notifying the rete network with the wrong wme
:-/. Now I keep selected `reconsider*wait* over and over again;
however, I'm a bit worried because I don't get new identifiers. Not
that I *expected* to, but I think that `real' Soar might regenerate
identifiers for each new operator that gets selected. Is that
necessary?


Monday, January 15, 2001

So the problem wasn't with propogating wmes into new rules: I was
incorrectly getting some conditions marked randomly as `acceptable'
tests (because I didn't initialize `acceptable' properly in the
`id_test' reduction). Anyway, got past that, but now it seems I'm
getting some token corruption while adding the wme to working memory.


Sunday, January 14, 2001

Seems like it might be a good thing to do away with `productions' in
the runtime. I don't see a real good reason that we need to remember
them.

It looks like the code that's supposed to propogate existing WMEs into
new rules is broken. Gotta look at that.


Monday, January 8, 2001

Need to finish up the semantic actions for rule right-hand
sides. Should simplify so that reductions can uniformly refer to $0 to
add actions.


Wednesday, January 3, 2001

I made WMEs just refer back to the slot they're in to pick up the `id'
and `attr' fields. Can we do the same with preferences?


Friday, December 29, 2000

Hacked up basic symbol table stuff, but will need to expand later to
cough up identifiers by `gc'-ing through live WMEs to find unused
ids. Left off while debugging preferences.


Thursday, December 28, 2000

Fixed the action struct's depth foo as described below.


Tuesday, December 26, 2000

Kludged my way through getting preference memory started. Need to fix
create_instantiation() to do bonafide `gensym'-ing. Maybe it's time to
make a real symbol table?

Also, I hard-coded the initialization of the action struct's `depth'
and `field' values when the rhs_value is a variable binding. That'll
need to move into the rule compilation. Maybe we can initialize with a
variable symbol, and then resolve when making the p-node?


Monday, December 25, 2000

Debugged a single-condition production. Now I'm bombing in a
production with two positive conditions. Gotta fix that.


Tuesday, December 19, 2000

I've got the basic stuff for alpha nodes, memory nodes, and positive
join nodes hooked up. I'm starting to go through debugging
|rete_add_wme()|, and am bombing out in the right-addition routine
because I'm not getting a binding for the `S1' stuff. Need to debug
that.


Tuesday, December 5, 2000

There's also starting to be a bit of redundant code, so a bit of
refactoring will probably be in order shortly.


Monday, December 4, 2000

The rete propogation stuff is buggy right now. The problem is that:

1) I'm just naively letting stuff meander down the net. This'll cause
instantiation nodes to get tickled more than once. I think I need to
make the tests more restrictive by default; esp. simple_test() should
return zero at the end?

2) (Maybe the same as 1, above) I need to be able to go out and check
working memory for values. When I see a WME in simple_test() that
doesn't have the same attribute as the node I'm looking at, I should
go out to working memory and see if there is any element that'll
satisfy my conditions, and only then propogate the stuff onward...
